# Rewriting the C4 Compiler in Rust

**Final Project â€” Principles of Programming Course (Khalifa University)**

This project is a Rust-based reimplementation of the original C4 compiler. Building upon our analysis from Assignment 1, we rewrote the compiler to maintain the same functionality and subset of the C language as the original version â€” including the ability to self-host â€” while taking advantage of Rustâ€™s memory safety, performance, and modern tooling.

---

## ðŸš€ Objective

Rebuild the C4 compiler in Rust with:

- The same parsing and execution logic as the original C version
- Full support for the original subset of C
- Enhanced safety and structure using Rust features
- Improved modular design (lexer, parser, VM)
